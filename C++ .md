 # 1. Procedural Programming vs Object Oriented Programming
### Procedural Programming Language:
Procedural Oriented Programming is a programming language that follows a step-by-step approach to break down a task into a collection of variables and routines (or subroutines) through a sequence of instructions. Each step is carried out in order in a systematic manner so that a computer can understand what to do.

### Object Oriented Programming
Object-oriented Programming is a programming language that uses classes and objects to create models based on the real world environment. In OOPs it makes it easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects are created inheriting characteristics from existing ones.

 # 2. High level, Middle level and Low level languages:

### High level langauge
These level languages provide almost everything that the programmer might need to do as already build into the language.
Example: Java, Python

### Middle level langauge
These languages don’t provide all the built-in functions found in high level languages, but provide all building blocks that we need to produce the result we want.
Example: C, C++

### Low level langauge
These languages provide nothing other than access to the machine’s basic instruction set.
Example: Assembly language.

# Class and Object
### Class
A class is the building block, that leads to Object-Oriented programming. It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A C++ class is like a blueprint for an object.

A Class is a user defined data-type which has data members and member functions.
Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to manipulate these variables and together these data members and member functions defines the properties and behavior of the objects in a Class.

### Object 
An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.
