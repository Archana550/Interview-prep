# Tell me about yourself



# 2.

* Thank You sir/ma'am for giving this opportunity to introduce myself, I am Tannu Kumari, currently I am pursuing B tech from University College of Engineering and Technology Vinoba Bhave University in Information technolg.


*  apart from my curriculum I have done a paid internship at coding Ninjas as a Teaching Assistant, My job there was to debug the code of students, suggesting them the optimal approach and algorithms for the problems, in addition to that I have also done freelancing job in Chegg India, where I have solved more than 200 problems in computer science asked by students from all over the world.


* I have also interned at sparks foundation as the web development and designing intern where I had developed a project on banking system.  the main idea behind the project was to make a website where a bank transactions can be noted down and a list can be maintained about your bank transacion, the tech stack which I had used were HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript and for the backend purpose I used MYSQL for maintaining the databse

* I also have done various projects using Tkinter framework of python,this is a GUI application in python which supports CRUD(create, read, update,   delete) operations using SQlite and I had created various widgets including Frame, Entry, Text, Buttons, Labels etc. which also supports reseting, displaying and pritning the data of the employee, for backend I had used MYSQL.
Also I have Developed a pet adoption website named ADOPET to encourage people to adopt stray animals using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.

* I have also done a mentorship program at Girlscript Foundation where I Mentored a group of students in building a project on a Library management system which was a C++ based software illustrating OOPS (Object Oriented Programming) concepts and supports CRUD operation, and is used to issue books which maintains the database in a binary file.

* Apart from studies I am pretty much interested in chess and I have also won gold medal in state level chess championship.
