# Virtual Function

A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class. When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the function. 

* Virtual functions ensure that the correct function is called for an object, regardless of the type of reference (or pointer) used for function call.
* They are mainly used to achieve Runtime polymorphism
* Functions are declared with a virtual keyword in base class.
* The resolving of function call is done at Run-time.

# OOPS Principal

## Incapsulation( way to abstraction)
***Definition***: Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. Another way to think about encapsulation is, it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.

***Real life examples***

If you are creating a function 

All the departments in a company have different works and contains different kinds of data, if any one wants to access the data from particualr dep. then they have to take the permission from that dept.

***Advantages***
* **Data Hiding** : The user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class. It will not be visible to the user how the class is storing values in the variables. The user will only know that we are passing the values to a setter method and variables are getting initialized with that value.

* **Increased Flexibility** : We can make the variables of the class read-only or write-only depending on our requirement. If we wish to make the variables read-only then we have to omit the setter methods like setName(), setAge(), etc. from the above program or if we wish to make the variables as write-only then we have to omit the get methods like getName(), getAge(), etc. from the above program

* **Reusability** : Encapsulation also improves the re-usability and is easy to change with new requirements.
Testing code is easy: Encapsulated code is easy to test for unit testing.

## Abstraction
Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user. The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user  Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components.

## Inheritence
 It is the mechanism by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class. 

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations

* Compile time Polymorphism
  * Function overloading 
  * Operator overloading
* Runtime Polymorphism
  

e.g man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee
