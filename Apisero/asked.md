# 1. About OOPS

OOPs refers to Object-Oriented Programming. It is the programming paradigm that is defined using objects. Objects can be considered as real-world instances of entities like class, that have some characteristics and behaviors.

 OOP allows us to break our problems into small unit of work that is represented via objects and their functions. We build functions around  objects.

Importance:
* OOPs helps users to understand the software easily, although they donâ€™t know the actual implementation.
* With OOPs, the readability, understandability, and maintainability of the code increase multifold.
* Even very big software can be easily written and managed easily using OOPs

Features:
* Inheritance
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Data Abstraction

# 2. Encapsulation and real time example

So Encapsulation is the process of binding data members and methods of a program together to do a specific job, without revealing unnecessary details.

# 3. DQL

Data Query Language (DQL) is part of the base grouping of SQL sub-languages. These sub-languages are mainly categorized into four categories: a data query language (DQL), a data definition language (DDL), a data control language (DCL), and a data manipulation language (DML). 

DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects. The purpose of DQL commands is to get the schema relation based on the query passed to it.

# 4. Object
Any real world entity which can have some characteristics or which can perform some tasks is called as Object.
In the real world, an object is an actual entity to which a user interacts
