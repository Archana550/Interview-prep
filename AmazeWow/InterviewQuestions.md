``` For each question, time complexity has to be told. ```

# Ques 1. Alternate reversal of linked list in a group of size k. Like the first group should be reversed, the second group should be the same, the third should be reversed, the fourth should be the same, etc.
```
Example : 

Input : 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8

k=2

Output : 2->1->3->4->6->5->7->8

```

# Ques 2. There are two strings given to find the matching and non-matching characters.

```
Example :

Input : s1 = abc s2 = abd 
Output : matching = 2 non-matching = 1
```
# Ques 3. 

# [#2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/amazon-interview-experience-amazewow-2020/)

# Ques 4.
# Ques 5. type of traversals in trees
# Ques 6. is there anyway to reconstruct the tree using these traversals.
# Ques 7. He then asked is there any exception to reconstruct tree using only one type of traversal. The answer was BST which was my coding question as- Construct the binary search tree using given preorder traversal.

# Ques 8: some basic paradigms of OOPCs , following with the difference between run time polymorphism and compile time polymorphism

# Ques 9: [Find k closest elements to a given value](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-closest-elements-given-value/) with first O(n) then the optimised one with O(logn+k).

# Ques 10: [Queue based approach for first non-repeating character in a stream.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-based-approach-for-first-non-repeating-character-in-a-stream/)

# Ques 11: Output the leaves of a tree in the first line, then output the nodes which will become leaves after removing the current leaves in the next line. We had to repeat this process until the tree was empty. This can be done by storing the height of each node. Output the nodes in ascending order of heights.

```He asked me the time and space complexities at each and every step. He also asked me to check my codes for edge cases.```

```Know the time and space complexities of every piece of code you write.```


# Ques 12: There is a stream of numbers scattered in memory, and we need to find out the frequency of corrupted data. Corrupted data resembles a given pattern. (Not sure if this was the exact question. It was a bit confusing.)

# Ques 13: This problem was a variation of one of the most famous Graphs problems, the Number of Islands. We’re given a 2D matrix of 0’s and 1’s, where 1 represents land, and 0 represents water. All the 1’s together represent an island. So, we need to find out:

* The number of islands
* The size of the largest island
* Number of islands nearest to a given coordinate

```Understand the problem completely: If you don’t get the question, ask the interviewer twice or thrice until you get the question correctly.```

```Keep talking: During the whole interview, you should be talking to the interviewer because if you stay silent, the interviewer won’t understand your thought process.```
```Comment your code: For every line of code, write short comments for your and interviewer’s ease.```
``` Always review your code: When you’re done with your coding, try to explain the algorithm with a sample test case and perform the complete dry run.```

# ques 14: 










# CS  fundamentals
# ques 1: In the first question of CS fundamentals, I was to perform Database Normalisation. In the second question, I was given a program in which I had to state whether the program would encounter a deadlock situation. If yes, how can you prevent the same with modifications in the code?

# ques 2: 2 Behavioral questions were also asked, behavioural questions at amazon interviews are primarily focused on their [leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en-gb/principles)

# ques 3: prepare these topics: [link](https://www.amazon.jobs/en-gb/landing_pages/software-development-topics)

* Find the most frequently occurring word in a sentence that is not in a given list of banned words: Divide the sentence into a stream of words, then use a hashmap to keep the count of the number of occurrences of each word that is not in the list of banned words and print the words from the hashmap with the maximum count.
